# Socket.io, Express, React

## Structure
The express server is hosted at root directory level.
Running ``npm install`` here includes the dependencies for Express and Socket.IO server side.

The ``client`` directory hosts the React front end.
Running ``npm install`` here will install React, Socket.IO client side, as well as Vite tooling and HMR.

## Run the Project
Run ``npm start`` in the ``client`` directory.
In another terminal, run ``node .`` in the root directory to start the server.
